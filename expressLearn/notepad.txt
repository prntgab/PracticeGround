//code to create server for express
import express from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3000;


app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}.`);
})

app.get("/", (req, res) =>{
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/index.html")
})
//Certainly! In Node.js, __dirname is a special keyword that refers to the directory name of the current module file. It’s like saying “where am I right now in my project’s folder structure?”
//For example, if you have a file located at C:\Users\YourName\Projects\MyApp\index.js, and you use __dirname inside that file, it will give you C:\Users\YourName\Projects\MyApp. This can be super handy when you need to work with file paths relative to where your script is running.
